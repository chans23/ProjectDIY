<h1 style="text-align:center;">Publishing to Me</h1>
<p> Publishing using raw language sure was hard but an experience! It was quite difficult for me to confirm my school account on GitHub because my ID was expired and I didn’t have any letters from UW-Green Bay for proof! I submitted three different documents for my account to get approved. When I decided to start, I watched the videos on Canvas BUT didn’t read the instructions (which comes to bite me later). I followed the steps to create a repository and upload my HTML. BUT when I published the HTML file didn’t work! I tried editing the file, removing it, and putting it on again to no avail. I looked up why it wasn’t working on reddit–found a few discussions but didn’t understand the jargon!!! Afterwords, I decided to consult YouTube. I found a video, but it was showing me the same things as the ones on Canvas! It was only after realizing that both files in the Canvas video and YouTube video were named “index.html” that I changed my HTML. It worked! Now that it was working, I could finally start the assignment. While reading the instructions, one of the tips was to name the file “index.html”! This problem could’ve been avoided if I had read the instructions but I can’t imagine how it must be for someone to create a website by themself and wondering why their HTML file didn’t work. Although I was frustrated and felt overwhelmed with navigating GitHub, when I successfully uploaded my HTML file, it felt so cool to know that I DID that. It made me rethink how digital publishing is referred to as easy. There is so much that goes into publishing digitally that people overlook! </p>
