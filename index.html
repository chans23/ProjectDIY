<p> Growing up with limited access to publications that I liked, owning a copy of my favorite manga, translated novel, or artbook is something special. Buying a physical copy means that I am supporting the creators and shows that there are people willing to spend money on this kind of genre. This means that there will be more investment in the genre.</p>
<blockquote>My appreciation for a published work goes as far as buying a copy in the original language or even in a different language!</blockquote>
<p>The idea of having a physical copy to prove that I am a published author manifests and is evident in this photo. Although digital publications cost less, the ability to share paid content is very easy because of the web. To own a printed copy lets me know that I am directly supporting creators.</p>
